    <h3>Bangers And Mash</h3>
    <p>This is a British staple on the dinner table often served with
        the complementary onion gravy. A family favourite for sure!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <uo>
        <li>6 Sausages of your choosing</li>
        <li>1kg of Potatoes</li>
        <li>75g of butter</li>
        <li>100ml of milk</li>
        <li>200g frozen peas</li>
    </uo>

    <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Heat the oven to 200C/ 180C fan. Heat a small bit of butter
            in a frying pan. Sizzle the sausages until brown on all sides (8-10 minutes)
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Put the potatoes in a pan of cold salted water and 
            bring them to the boil and simmer for 10-12 minutes or until
            just cooked all the way through. Drain in a colander
            then put the potatoes through a ricer. Add the potatoes and butter
            to a pan with 100ml of milk and bring to serving temperature while mixing it all in.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>While the potatoes and sausages are cooking bring a 
            small pan of water to the boil. When the potatoes are in the pan
            and the sausages are just out of the oven put some peas into the boiling water.
            Drain when they are al dente and serve all 3 together.
