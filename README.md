This is a basic website in a brutalist style showing a few recipes. 
This will help firm my foundation in HTML by showcasing various skills I have learned thus far.

Skills I hope to have used/shown by the end of this project include:

- creating a boilerplate with correct style and syntax.
- creating multiple pages with links to them from the main page.
- using best practices when writing in HTML
- showing a clear and often commit log.
- show an understanding and use of HTML text, images and media.

This will be done over many iterations to ensure it is complete to the best standard of my current knowledge. I hope to come back at various stages of the Odin Project to update this website with new skills and expertise. I will include a paragraph here for each time I do to reflect on what I have learned and to be happpy with my progress :)
